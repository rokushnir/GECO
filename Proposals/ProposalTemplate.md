## Your Proposal 
### Project description
The LCP SPE project that my team and I are launching is a training tote in which the participant buys a course bets on himself that will pass it to the end. Now I am looking for a grant program from the ecosystem in which we will develop our project. A project that will change the incentives in education and grow into an educational metaverse.
### Features
vue.js+laravel
### Team description
Our team has 13 years of experience in the traditional EdTech market, more than 50,000 participants have taken my courses and I know very well how to make the learning process as effective and interesting as possible for the participant through the right incentives.
